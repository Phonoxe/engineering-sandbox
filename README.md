▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Clone or download the project.

From the project root, run:

python main.py

📋 Menu Options

When the program starts, you will see:

1. Add an item
2. See the list of items
3. Delete an item
4. Exit


Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform.

🧪 Data Format

Items are stored in data/data.json using the following structure:

[
  {
    "name": "Milk",
    "date": "12/07/2026"
  }
]


Dates must follow the format:

DD/MM/YYYY

📊 Item Display Logic

Expired items are detected by comparing the expiration date with the current date.

Non-expired items:

Include the number of days until expiration

Are sorted from soonest to latest expiration

⚠️ Notes & Limitations

Item names are not unique; if multiple items share the same name, you will be asked which one to delete.

Input validation is implemented for dates and menu choices.

This is a local CLI tool (no database, no GUI).

🚀 Possible Improvements

Add item categories

Improve error handling

Add unit tests

Add a graphical interface

Automatically create data.json if missing
