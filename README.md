# Engineering Sandbox

## What's up?

This repository is about creating an environment for EPF students to try out GitHub features alongside engineering skills, planning and designing on one hand and collaborating and solving technical issues together on the other hand.

## A word of warning

```
Most of the textual content below has been generated from transcripts of classes with 2025's 5A.

It has then been reviewed to match pedagogical expectations.
```

## Skills

- **Methodological rigor**: planning and scoping to deliver on commitments
- **Technical collaboration**: building and maintaining a system collectively

### Methodological rigor

Includes: planning & estimation, documentation structure, ticket management, data quality & specifications, scope management, output vs outcome, quality standards

**Essence**: Know how to estimate (×2 +10%), structure work (Why/What/How/When), define realistic scope, aim for impact (outcome) rather than production (output), and maintain professional quality standards.

### Technical collaboration

Includes: efficiency vs effectiveness, technical documentation & architecture, GitHub & version control, collective code ownership, centralization vs fragmentation, tool mastery, architecture & technical debt, review & team blocking

**Essence**: Work as a team on shared codebase (Git/PRs), create documented and maintainable architecture, depersonalize code, avoid fragmentation, master collaborative tools, manage technical debt.

## Key concepts

# Key concepts

### **1. Efficiency vs Effectiveness**

**Efficiency** is the ratio between effectiveness and safety. Being effective without consideration for sustainability or safety puts the system at risk. Efficiency means being productive without compromising the robustness and maintainability of the system. This is a fundamental concept to avoid burnout - working to exhaustion without a long-term vision.

### **2. Planning and estimation**

**Estimation rule**: multiply the optimistic estimate by 2, then add 10% to get the pessimistic estimate. This rule helps anticipate risks (failures, blockers, unforeseen events). Distinguish total available time from actual working time (meetings, other tasks). Importance of documenting reasons for delays directly in tickets to facilitate future understanding.

### **3. Documentation structure (Design Document)**

**Why - What - How - When**: This structure (also called specifications or requirements document) structures each task:

- **Why**: justification for the work
- **What**: objective to achieve
- **How**: possible solutions and their advocacy (what we do AND what we don't do)
- **When**: timeline estimates

### **4. Professional meeting preparation**

Before each meeting, review: what you worked on, what colleagues worked on, current issues, what needs discussion. Adopt a methodical and factual approach. Update Trello/dashboard BEFORE the meeting to compare forecasts vs reality.

### **5. Agile method and client rhythm**

Regular meetings with the client (every 2 weeks) serve as the "final arbiter" to validate progress. After each client meeting, set objectives for the next one. The client must validate what is good, what is not, and what remains to be done. Create mock-ups when the client doesn't have a clear idea.

### **6. Ticket and task management**

Create clear and detailed tickets with all necessary details for overall understanding. Subdivide a ticket if multiple tasks are discovered. Avoid being too vague or too precise. Always know: why we're doing it, what we must do, when to deliver it, and **especially what we're not doing**.

### **7. Technical documentation and architecture**

Importance of creating architecture diagrams (even simple ones: input, output, constraint). A picture is worth a thousand words. Document for two audiences: end users AND developers taking over the project. Identify stakeholders and their specific documentation needs.

### **8. Team collaboration and communication**

**Proactive communication**: send messages/audio to the group to inform about modifications, results and problems encountered. **Pair programming**: two brains working together (500% efficiency) - one observes and guides, the other acts. **Presence communication**: notify the team of your availability because the team moves forward with or without each member.

### **9. GitHub and version control**

Use feature branches, merge with main then delete after validation. Create pull requests. Create **GitHub issues** to document improvement opportunities, bugs, and what works well. Use tags for versioning.

### **10. Data quality and specifications**

**Crucial lesson**: always ask to see the data BEFORE committing to a project. Project specifications must be clear from the start. If the team discovers a gap between expectations and reality, adapt the roadmap quickly and communicate diplomatically with the client.

### **11. Presentation: double triangle technique**

Structure going from global to technical:

- **First triangle (broad → precise)**: first present the big picture with technical foundation, then features with technical tools, finally technical specifications responding to specific challenges
- **Second technical triangle**: will likely be smaller than the global part
- Address a single person, use structured images

### **12. Professional justification and transparency**

In case of difficulties or delays: be transparent, acknowledge weaknesses upfront, propose improvement recommendations for each problem, highlight what worked well. Show your capacity for progress rather than just your current technical level.

### **13. Team communication and crisis management**

**Gentle communication** is essential when a member disappears or becomes desynchronized. Don't wait for a problem to worsen: intervene quickly but with kindness. Establish presence/availability rituals. If a member is absent, the team must continue moving forward while maintaining contact.

### **14. Collective code ownership**

**"The code doesn't belong to me"**: crucial transition from personal development to team code. Code must be **depersonalized** so that each member can contribute without psychological barriers. This requires naming conventions, clear comments, coherent structure, and acceptance that "my" code becomes "our" code.

### **15. Centralization and fragmentation**

Avoid **work fragmentation**: when each member works in their own repository or environment, integration becomes nightmarish. Establish from the start **a central repository** with clear folder structure. Define who is responsible for what, where to push their work, and how to integrate it.

### **16. Tool mastery before use**

Don't assume students master Trello, GitHub, or any other tool even after a presentation. **Teach concrete usage** with examples, templates, and follow-up. A poorly understood tool becomes a burden rather than a help. Verify understanding through guided practice.

### **17. Scope management and realism**

**Clean house** regularly: what are we **really** going to do? Who is **really** available? When do we draw the conclusion? Abandoning unproductive paths is not failure but mature management. Document what is abandoned and why.

### **18. Client relationship and autonomy**

When the client is **too lax** or absent, the team must make validation decisions themselves (constructive "mutiny"). But beware: document these decisions and their justifications to protect the team. Propose validation milestones to the client even if they don't request them.

### **19. Professionalism and punctuality**

**Respect schedules**: 10 minutes late without notification is professionally unacceptable. Communicate proactively in case of unforeseen events. Propose meetings with **agenda shared in advance** to allow preparation. Being on time means respecting others' time.

### **20. Output vs Outcome**

**Output** = produced result (lines of code, completed tickets, delivered features). **Outcome** = real impact, problems solved, value created for the user. A burndown chart can mask reality: completing many poorly designed tickets creates no value. The **success criteria** are not "produce code" but "solve the client's problem".

### **21. Quality standards and proofreading**

**Proofread multiple times** before delivering. Spelling errors in the client's name or euphemisms ("quite unfamiliar" instead of "completely lost") harm credibility. Establish explicit **quality standards** for the team. Avoid "etc." or "to be honest" in professional deliverables.

### **22. Architecture and technical debt**

Working in an **unclean architecture** with poor knowledge of the project/language generates conflicts and blockages. Sometimes necessary to "hack" the architecture to rebuild it properly. Create **architecture diagrams** even simple ones. If the diagram is too large for the screen, present a zoomed-out view then zoom in on each step.

### **23. Presentation and visual support**

**Get out of slides**: present the **live Kanban**, the **mockup itself**, the **dashboard running locally**. Use **screenshots** to show real tools. Structure "where you come from → where you're going" (motivation grid). Integrate tools in slides with justification: "why each tool for which specific problem".

### **24. Review and team blocking**

Don't **wait indefinitely** for a member to do their review. Establish review deadlines (e.g., 24h) after which you can merge with another member's approval. PR blocking by a reviewer's absence paralyzes the entire team.

### **25. Sincerity and vulnerability**

**Don't use euphemisms** to mask difficulties. Say "we were completely lost" rather than "quite unfamiliar". Showing **adaptation capacity** in the face of difficulties is an engineering skill. Using Figma AI + ChatGPT/Cursor when you don't know how to design an interface is an intelligent solution, not a weakness.
